Hello!
My name is Timothy Bency, I am a 14 year old living in the Uniited Arab Emirates.
I am a typical coder with preety less knowledge about coding but i aspire to know more about it in the future.
I started by learning python out of curiosity and fell in love with coding,learning the language inspired me to learn html and css.
I am in the procees of learning java.Dont take me as a proffesional as always deal with bugs here and there(i cant go 3 lines of code with out checking a tutorial)
I currently am part of of coding club called hack club.My current dream is to do a prject with aspirinf coders like me.
